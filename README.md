Outstanding Issues:
- "Wrong" movie choices are hard-programmed. Would like to pull randomly from larger array.
- Would like to build an API for hosting more video clips and more wrong movie choices.
- Timer and scoreing start instantly on round-start. On slower connections, score and time could drop considerably before video is identifiable. Not sure how to rectify.
