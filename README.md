# Movie-Trivia
Its movie trivia time!

![Alt text](/images/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Home Page Screenshot")

This project was built very early on in my Web Developer Immersive bootcamp with General Assembly (week 3). The goal was to test the front-end skills we had learned up to that point (JS, jQuery, HTML, CSS) and build a working game in 3 days using only DOM manupulation and without using a database. The app is very simple, and the total number of trivia questions is very limited, but the scorekeeping, live timer countdown, and round progression were all great learning experiences for me, having only been developing for 2 weeks. 

**Links:**
- Link to live game site (gh-pages) - https://gregbrunk.github.io/Movie-Trivia/
- Wireframes - see "Wireframes" folder in the project repo (or in Trello).
- Trello Project Board - https://trello.com/b/FXdaRyG6/movie-trivia-game.

**Technologies Used:**
- Javascript and jQuery
- Bootstrap CSS and JS
- SweetAlert CSS and JS (For awesome alerts and prompts)

**What's next?:**
- Mobile optimize the whole experience.
- "Wrong" movie choices are hard-programmed. Would like to pull randomly from larger array.
- Would like to build an API/Database for hosting more video clips and more wrong movie choices.

**Outstanding Issues:**
- gh-pages hosted site is not pulling in youTube videos - says it is an insecure resource. Need to investigate. - FIXED
- Timer and scoreing start instantly on round-start. On slower connections, score and time could drop considerably before video is identifiable. Possibly implement a way to start only on page load completion.

**Installation Instructions:**

*This app was developed as Project #1 for my General Assembly Denver - WDI Immersive course.*
